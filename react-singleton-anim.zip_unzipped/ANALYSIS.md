# Repository Analysis

This document summarizes the structure and behavior of the Singleton visualization contained in this repository, highlighting the important components, data flow, and supporting assets that power the interactive walkthrough.

## High-Level Architecture

- **Vite + React application** located under `src/`, bootstrapped via `vite.config.js` and `index.html`.
- The visualization is centered on the Singleton design pattern, pairing code snippets with diagrammatic steps.
- Assets such as the Java source file (`src/assets/singleton.java`) and step definitions (`src/data/singletonSteps.js`) drive the live experience.

## Core React Components

### `App.jsx`
- Orchestrates the playback loop for the step-by-step visualization by iterating through `singletonSteps`.
- Synchronizes the diagram, code pane, and player controls while handling auto-play timing and manual navigation.
- Manages state for the current step, playback speed, and whether the walkthrough is active.

### `CodePane.jsx`
- Wraps Monaco Editor in read-only mode to present the highlighted Java code.
- Applies range decorations and scroll positioning to keep the active lines centered.
- Reacts to step changes to update highlight ranges and provides smooth transitions for readability.

### `PatternDiagram.jsx`
- Builds a React Flow graph representing clients, the singleton class internals, and any auxiliary nodes referenced by the current step.
- Uses Framer Motion to animate pulses and glows on nodes based on step metadata (e.g., `pulseNodes`, `glowNodes`).
- Injects step-specific edges and visual emphasis, although some step fields like `annotate`, `badges`, and `spawnNodes` are not yet rendered.

### `PlayerBar.jsx`
- Exposes transport controls (play/pause, next/previous, speed adjustments) that manipulate the state managed by `App.jsx`.
- Displays progress through the step sequence and integrates keyboard-accessible controls.

## Supporting Files and Data

- `src/data/singletonSteps.js` defines the ordered sequence of visualization steps, including which lines to highlight, diagram node states, and step captions.
- `src/assets/singleton.java` contains the canonical double-checked locking implementation that aligns with the visualization steps.
- `index.css` sets up the split-pane layout, code highlighting treatment, diagram styling, and floating player bar presentation.

## Customization Notes

To adapt the visualization for another design pattern:

1. **Code Asset** – Replace or add a source file under `src/assets/` that contains the reference implementation for the new pattern.
2. **Step Definitions** – Create a new step file in `src/data/` mirroring the `singletonSteps` shape to describe highlights, node states, and captions.
3. **Component Wiring** – Update `App.jsx` to import the new steps and code asset, and adjust any diagram nodes or layout specifics required for the new pattern.
4. **Styling Adjustments** – Extend `index.css` if the new visualization requires unique colors, node badges, or layout tweaks.

## Development Workflow

- Run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` inside `react-singleton-anim.zip_unzipped/` to start the Vite development server.
- Use `npm run build` for production builds and `npm run preview` to serve the built assets locally.

This analysis should serve as a quick reference for understanding the existing Singleton visualization and as a guide for extending the framework to additional design patterns.
